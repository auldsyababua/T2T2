## 2025-06-11 17:30 PST - Initial Project Setup & Architecture

### What Was Done:
1. **Git Setup**: Initialized repo with remote origin `git@github.com:auldsyababua/T2T2.git`
2. **Project Structure**: Created backend (FastAPI) and existing frontend (React) structure
3. **Database Models**: Set up SQLAlchemy models with pgvector support for embeddings
4. **API Routes**: Created auth, telegram, query, and timeline endpoints
5. **Docker**: Added docker-compose.yml for local development

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Cloud-First Approach**: All services in cloud for easier user onboarding
  - Database: Supabase (pgvector support, free tier)
  - Cache: Upstash Redis (serverless)
  - Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
  - Storage: AWS S3 for images
- **Security**: JWT auth with Telegram Mini App HMAC verification
- **Multi-tenant**: One bot serves all users with RLS data isolation

### Current State:
- Backend structure complete but missing service implementations
- Need cloud credentials for: Supabase, Upstash, AWS S3
- Frontend exists but needs connection to backend

### Next Steps:
1. User needs to set up cloud services (see SETUP_CHECKLIST.md)
2. Implement TelegramService for Telethon QR auth
3. Implement RAGService for embeddings and search
4. Connect frontend to backend API

## 2025-06-11 18:00 PST - Added Logging, Tests, and CI/CD

### What Was Done:
1. **Comprehensive Logging**: 
   - Created centralized logging utility with specialized functions
   - Added logging to main app, database, and auth modules
   - Logs include: API requests/responses, DB queries, Telegram events, embeddings
   - Rotating file handler to prevent huge log files

2. **Unit Test Framework**:
   - Set up pytest with async support
   - Created fixtures for mocking: DB, Telegram, OpenAI, Redis, S3
   - Added tests for auth endpoints and database models
   - Test coverage reporting configured

3. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**:
   - Backend CI: linting (black, ruff), tests, Docker build
   - Frontend CI: type checking, linting, build
   - Automatic on push/PR for relevant paths

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - Created `run_tests.sh` for local testing
   - Only using necessary MCPs (GitHub, Filesystem)
   - Clear separation of concerns

### Why These Changes Increase Success:
- **Logging**: Immediate visibility into what's happening
- **Tests**: Catch errors before they cascade
- **CI/CD**: Automated safety net on every commit
- **Together**: Forms the "90% error reduction" pattern - smaller feedback loops

### Current State:
- All infrastructure ready for service implementations
- Waiting on cloud service credentials:
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
  - Upstash (Redis)
  - AWS S3 (image storage)
