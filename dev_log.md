## 2025-06-11 17:30 PST - Initial Project Setup & Architecture

### What Was Done:
1. **Git Setup**: Initialized repo with remote origin `git@github.com:auldsyababua/T2T2.git`
2. **Project Structure**: Created backend (FastAPI) and existing frontend (React) structure
3. **Database Models**: Set up SQLAlchemy models with pgvector support for embeddings
4. **API Routes**: Created auth, telegram, query, and timeline endpoints
5. **Docker**: Added docker-compose.yml for local development

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Cloud-First Approach**: All services in cloud for easier user onboarding
  - Database: Supabase (pgvector support, free tier)
  - Cache: Upstash Redis (serverless)
  - Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
  - Storage: AWS S3 for images
- **Security**: JWT auth with Telegram Mini App HMAC verification
- **Multi-tenant**: One bot serves all users with RLS data isolation

### Current State:
- Backend structure complete but missing service implementations
- Need cloud credentials for: Supabase, Upstash, AWS S3
- Frontend exists but needs connection to backend

### Next Steps:
1. User needs to set up cloud services (see SETUP_CHECKLIST.md)
2. Implement TelegramService for Telethon QR auth
3. Implement RAGService for embeddings and search
4. Connect frontend to backend API

## 2025-06-11 18:00 PST - Added Logging, Tests, and CI/CD

### What Was Done:
1. **Comprehensive Logging**: 
   - Created centralized logging utility with specialized functions
   - Added logging to main app, database, and auth modules
   - Logs include: API requests/responses, DB queries, Telegram events, embeddings
   - Rotating file handler to prevent huge log files

2. **Unit Test Framework**:
   - Set up pytest with async support
   - Created fixtures for mocking: DB, Telegram, OpenAI, Redis, S3
   - Added tests for auth endpoints and database models
   - Test coverage reporting configured

3. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**:
   - Backend CI: linting (black, ruff), tests, Docker build
   - Frontend CI: type checking, linting, build
   - Automatic on push/PR for relevant paths

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - Created `run_tests.sh` for local testing
   - Only using necessary MCPs (GitHub, Filesystem)
   - Clear separation of concerns

### Why These Changes Increase Success:
- **Logging**: Immediate visibility into what's happening
- **Tests**: Catch errors before they cascade
- **CI/CD**: Automated safety net on every commit
- **Together**: Forms the "90% error reduction" pattern - smaller feedback loops

### Current State:
- All infrastructure ready for service implementations
- Waiting on cloud service credentials:
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
  - Upstash (Redis)
  - AWS S3 (image storage)

## 2025-06-11 18:30 PST - Implemented Core Services

### What Was Done:
1. **TelegramService Implementation**:
   - QR-based authentication using Telethon
   - Session management with client caching
   - Message indexing with deduplication
   - Media handling preparation
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **RAGService Implementation**:
   - OpenAI text-embedding-3-large integration
   - Text chunking with overlap for context
   - Vector similarity search using pgvector
   - Timeline generation for related messages
   - Result caching in database

3. **ImageService Implementation**:
   - Tesseract OCR integration
   - CLIP image embeddings
   - S3 storage with deduplication
   - Image metadata extraction
   - Async processing pipeline

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Service Isolation**: Each service handles one domain (Telegram, RAG, Images)
- **Async First**: All I/O operations are async for better performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with logging
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints for better maintainability
- **Resource Management**: Client/session reuse where possible

### Why These Changes Increase Success:
- **Modularity**: Services can be tested and deployed independently
- **Scalability**: Async operations prevent blocking
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Efficient resource usage and caching

### Current State:
- Core services implemented and ready for testing
- Need to implement media handling in TelegramService
- Need to add rate limiting for API calls
- Need to implement caching layer for embeddings

### Next Steps:
1. Write unit tests for all services
2. Implement media handling in TelegramService
3. Add rate limiting and caching
4. Set up monitoring for service health

## 2025-06-11 19:00 PST - Agent Guidelines & Git Checkpointing

### What Was Done:
1. **Created AGENT_GUIDELINES.md**:
   - Comprehensive git checkpointing requirements for AI agents
   - Commit frequency guidelines (every 15-20 min or logical unit)
   - Clear commit message format and examples
   - Recovery procedures for when development goes wrong
   - Integration with todo system for traceability

### Why This Change:
- User identified that lack of git checkpoints led to previous development going "off the rails"
- Regular commits create a safety net and clear history
- Enables easy rollback and debugging when issues arise
- Ensures smooth handoffs between different AI agents

### Key Guidelines:
- Commit after each logical unit of work
- Use descriptive commit messages with type prefixes
- Create checkpoint commits before major changes
- Document blockers with WIP commits
- Always commit before switching agents

### Current State:
- Agent guidelines documented and ready for use
- All future agents should follow these practices
- Enables better project stability and recovery

### Next Steps:
1. Ensure all agents read AGENT_GUIDELINES.md at session start
2. Continue with pending tasks from todo list
3. Apply git checkpointing practices going forward
