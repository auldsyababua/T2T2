# T2T2 Project Handoff Document

<!-- 
ðŸ¤– AI AGENT: START HERE
This project has AUTOMATIC safety monitoring. You don't need to run any commands.
Just start working - all safety features are already active.
-->

## Project Overview
T2T2 is a task-to-transcript system that helps manage AI coding sessions.

## Current State
- Basic project structure created
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrated for AI safety
- Dependencies configured in package.json

## Next Steps
1. Implement the REST API for user management
2. Add authentication system
3. Create task tracking endpoints
4. Build transcript generation features

## Important Context
- This project uses automatic AI safety monitoring
- All code is auto-checked for quality and security
- Commits are enforced every 30 minutes or 100 lines of code

## ðŸ¤– AI Agent Section (AUTO-MANAGED)

### System Status
- **Monitoring**: âœ… Active
- **Auto-linting**: âœ… Enabled  
- **Safety snapshots**: âœ… Every 30 min
- **Commit enforcement**: âœ… Active

### Your Instructions
1. **Read `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Full autonomous system guide
2. **Start coding** - Everything else is automatic
3. **Check status** - Look for `FIX_REQUIRED.md` or `COMMIT_REQUIRED.md` files

### If You See These Files:
- `COMMIT_REQUIRED.md` - You must commit your changes
- `FIX_REQUIRED.md` - Code issues need fixing (usually auto-fixed)
- `RISKY_OPERATION_BLOCKED.md` - System blocked dangerous code
- `RECOVERY_OPTIONS.md` - Something went wrong, follow instructions

### Automatic Features Active:
```
âœ… Code quality checks after every save
âœ… Security scanning for hardcoded secrets  
âœ… Backup snapshots before risky operations
âœ… Dependency checking and auto-install
âœ… Git commit enforcement (30 min/100 lines/3 files)
âœ… Critical file protection (package.json, etc.)
âœ… Error detection and auto-recovery
```

### You DON'T Need To:
- Run linting commands (automatic)
- Create backups (automatic)
- Check code quality (automatic)
- Remember safety commands (all automatic)

### Just Focus On:
- Writing code
- Following the project requirements
- Committing when prompted
