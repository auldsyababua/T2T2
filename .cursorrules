# Cursor AI Rules for T2T2 Project

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW PROCESS

At the start of EVERY conversation:
1. ALWAYS read `workflow_state.md` FIRST
2. Check the current phase and active task
3. Follow the phase requirements exactly
4. Update workflow_state.md after significant actions

## WORKFLOW PHASES

### IDLE
- Wait for task assignment
- Do not proceed without a task

### ANALYZE
- Explore and understand the requirement
- Read relevant code files
- Document discoveries in workflow_state.md
- NO implementation yet

### BLUEPRINT
- Create detailed implementation plan
- Update Blueprint section in workflow_state.md
- STOP and wait for user approval
- DO NOT proceed to CONSTRUCT without approval

### CONSTRUCT
- Implement according to approved blueprint
- Update Implementation Log in workflow_state.md
- Commit code changes regularly

### VALIDATE
- Run tests
- Verify implementation
- Document results in workflow_state.md
- Mark task complete when done

## FILE RULES

1. **Read workflow_state.md** at the start of EVERY response
2. **Update workflow_state.md** after:
   - Phase transitions
   - Significant discoveries
   - Implementation steps
   - Test results

3. **For parallel tasks**, use `workflow_state_[taskname].md`
   - Copy from workflow_state_template.md
   - Keep separate from main workflow

4. **Reference project_config.md** for:
   - Architecture decisions
   - Development rules
   - Security requirements

## STRICT REQUIREMENTS

- NEVER skip reading workflow_state.md
- NEVER proceed past BLUEPRINT without approval
- NEVER create files without explicit request
- NEVER add comments to code
- ALWAYS update the workflow state file
- ALWAYS follow the current phase requirements

## GIT PRACTICES

- Commit after each logical unit
- Use descriptive messages: feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.
- Update dev_log.md with session notes

## ERROR HANDLING

If confused or blocked:
1. Document the issue in workflow_state.md
2. Set phase to IDLE
3. Ask user for clarification

## VALIDATION

Before marking any task complete:
- All tests must pass
- Code must be linted
- Documentation must be updated
- workflow_state.md must reflect completion
