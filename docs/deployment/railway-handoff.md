# Railway Deployment Handoff Document

## Current Status
- **Project**: T2T2 (Talk to Telegram) QR Authentication Server
- **Service**: T2T2 on Railway
- **URL**: https://t2t2-production.up.railway.app
- **Branch**: refactor/tdlib-chat-history
- **Last Deployment**: Failed (4 minutes ago)

## What We've Done

### 1. Code Changes
- ✅ Archived `main.py` to prevent conflicts
- ✅ Updated `t2t2_chat_indexer.py` to show QR auth URL instead of admin message
- ✅ Added Railway URL to bot: `https://t2t2-production.up.railway.app`
- ✅ Removed UI directory from git to prevent Deno build attempts
- ✅ Created `.railwayignore` to exclude unnecessary directories

### 2. Railway Configuration
- ✅ Created `railway.json` with proper Python configuration
- ✅ Set start command: `python t2t2_qr_auth.py`
- ✅ Configured health check endpoint: `/health`
- ✅ Added all required environment variables in Railway dashboard

### 3. Environment Variables Added to Railway
- `TELEGRAM_API_ID`
- `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

### 4. Automation Setup
- ✅ Added Railway token to `~/.config/mcp/.env`
- ✅ Created deployment scripts in `.scratch/`:
  - `railway-cli-wrapper.sh` - Wrapper for Railway CLI commands
  - `railway-deploy-fix.sh` - Automated deployment with retry logic
  - `railway-logs-monitor.sh` - Log monitoring script

## Current Issue
The deployment is failing but we can't access logs via CLI due to token authentication format mismatch.

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Debug (Fastest)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open the T2T2 project
3. Click on the T2T2 service
4. Go to the Deployments tab
5. Click on the failed deployment
6. Copy the error logs and share them

### Option 2: CLI Access
1. In terminal, run:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/T2T2
   railway login
   railway logs --service T2T2 --deployment
   ```
2. Share the output

### Option 3: Check Common Issues
Look for these in the logs:
- **"ModuleNotFoundError"** - Missing Python dependency
- **"cannot import name"** - Import error in code
- **"Healthcheck failed"** - Server not starting on correct port
- **"pip: command not found"** - Build configuration issue

## Quick Fixes for Common Issues

### If it's a missing module:
```bash
# Add to requirements.txt
echo "module_name==version" >> requirements.txt
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "fix: add missing dependency"
git push origin refactor/tdlib-chat-history
```

### If it's a health check failure:
The server might not be starting. Check that:
1. `PORT` environment variable is being used
2. Server binds to `0.0.0.0` not `localhost`
3. `/health` endpoint returns 200 OK

### If it's a build error:
Railway might be detecting the wrong project type. Ensure:
1. No `package.json` in root
2. No `deno.json` or TypeScript files
3. `requirements.txt` is present

## Summary
The QR authentication server is ready to deploy but failing. Once we see the error logs, it should be a quick fix. The most likely issues are:
1. Missing Python dependency
2. Import error from archived files
3. Health check configuration

Get the logs and the fix should be straightforward!
