## 2025-06-11 17:30 PST - Initial Project Setup & Architecture

### What Was Done:
1. **Git Setup**: Initialized repo with remote origin `git@github.com:auldsyababua/T2T2.git`
2. **Project Structure**: Created backend (FastAPI) and existing frontend (React) structure
3. **Database Models**: Set up SQLAlchemy models with pgvector support for embeddings
4. **API Routes**: Created auth, telegram, query, and timeline endpoints
5. **Docker**: Added docker-compose.yml for local development

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Cloud-First Approach**: All services in cloud for easier user onboarding
  - Database: Supabase (pgvector support, free tier)
  - Cache: Upstash Redis (serverless)
  - Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
  - Storage: AWS S3 for images
- **Security**: JWT auth with Telegram Mini App HMAC verification
- **Multi-tenant**: One bot serves all users with RLS data isolation

### Current State:
- Backend structure complete but missing service implementations
- Need cloud credentials for: Supabase, Upstash, AWS S3
- Frontend exists but needs connection to backend

### Next Steps:
1. User needs to set up cloud services (see SETUP_CHECKLIST.md)
2. Implement TelegramService for Telethon QR auth
3. Implement RAGService for embeddings and search
4. Connect frontend to backend API

## 2025-06-11 18:00 PST - Added Logging, Tests, and CI/CD

### What Was Done:
1. **Comprehensive Logging**: 
   - Created centralized logging utility with specialized functions
   - Added logging to main app, database, and auth modules
   - Logs include: API requests/responses, DB queries, Telegram events, embeddings
   - Rotating file handler to prevent huge log files

2. **Unit Test Framework**:
   - Set up pytest with async support
   - Created fixtures for mocking: DB, Telegram, OpenAI, Redis, S3
   - Added tests for auth endpoints and database models
   - Test coverage reporting configured

3. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**:
   - Backend CI: linting (black, ruff), tests, Docker build
   - Frontend CI: type checking, linting, build
   - Automatic on push/PR for relevant paths

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - Created `run_tests.sh` for local testing
   - Only using necessary MCPs (GitHub, Filesystem)
   - Clear separation of concerns

### Why These Changes Increase Success:
- **Logging**: Immediate visibility into what's happening
- **Tests**: Catch errors before they cascade
- **CI/CD**: Automated safety net on every commit
- **Together**: Forms the "90% error reduction" pattern - smaller feedback loops

### Current State:
- All infrastructure ready for service implementations
- Waiting on cloud service credentials:
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
  - Upstash (Redis)
  - AWS S3 (image storage)

## 2025-06-11 19:00 PST - Agent Guidelines & Git Checkpointing

### What Was Done:
1. **Created AGENT_GUIDELINES.md**:
   - Comprehensive git checkpointing requirements for AI agents
   - Commit frequency guidelines (every 15-20 min or logical unit)
   - Clear commit message format and examples
   - Recovery procedures for when development goes wrong
   - Integration with todo system for traceability

### Why This Change:
- User identified that lack of git checkpoints led to previous development going "off the rails"
- Regular commits create a safety net and clear history
- Enables easy rollback and debugging when issues arise
- Ensures smooth handoffs between different AI agents

### Key Guidelines:
- Commit after each logical unit of work
- Use descriptive commit messages with type prefixes
- Create checkpoint commits before major changes
- Document blockers with WIP commits
- Always commit before switching agents

### Current State:
- Agent guidelines documented and ready for use
- All future agents should follow these practices
- Enables better project stability and recovery

### Next Steps:
1. Ensure all agents read AGENT_GUIDELINES.md at session start
2. Continue with pending tasks from todo list
3. Apply git checkpointing practices going forward

### 2025-06-11 19:15 PST - Commit: f745fd3
- Created HANDOFF.md as master entry point for new agents
- Enhanced AGENT_GUIDELINES.md with mandatory dev log updates after commits
- Established single "read HANDOFF.md" instruction for agent onboarding
- Agents now required to update dev_log.md with commit hash after each commit

## 2025-06-11 19:30 PST - Robust Documentation System

### What Was Done - Commit: 6bbc5b8
1. **Created ENVIRONMENT.md**:
   - Complete system dependencies and versions
   - Environment variable reference
   - Validation script to check setup
   - Common environment issues and solutions

2. **Created CRITICAL_PATHS.md**:
   - Marked critical code paths with visual indicators
   - Documented architecture invariants
   - Added testing commands for each critical path
   - Included monitoring checklist

3. **Added Dev Log Rotation**:
   - Created `scripts/rotate_dev_log.py` to prevent context overflow
   - Archives old entries after 10 sessions
   - Generates summary for quick reference
   - Updated .gitignore to preserve archives

4. **Enhanced Agent Guidelines**:
   - Added documentation refresh protocol
   - Every 10 commits requires doc review
   - Verification scripts for doc accuracy

### Why These Changes:
- Addresses document consistency concerns
- Prevents context limit issues with log rotation
- Improves code understanding with critical path annotations
- Eliminates environment ambiguity
- Ensures documentation stays current

### Current State:
- Comprehensive documentation system in place
- Single entry point via HANDOFF.md
- Automated log management
- Clear critical code identification

### Next Steps:
1. Test dev log rotation script
2. Continue with pending todos from todo list
3. All agents must follow new documentation protocol

### 2025-06-11 19:45 PST - Commit: 17e6b2c
- Created compressed versions of all documentation
- Achieved 67% total character reduction (14,426→4,726 chars)
- Used symbols, shorthand, visual hierarchy, and content pruning
- Agents can now use HANDOFF_COMPACT.md to save context
- Full versions retained for detailed reference 

## 2025-06-12 09:00 PST - Added Rate Limiting & Cache Layer (Commit: <pending>)

### What Was Done:
1. **RateLimitMiddleware** (backend/api/middleware/rate_limit.py)
   - Sliding-window IP rate limiting (100 req/60 sec default)
   - Returns `429` with `Retry-After` and standard `X-RateLimit-*` headers
   - Uses shared cache backend for counters
2. **Cache Utility** (backend/utils/cache.py)
   - Simple async cache wrapper
   - Prefers Upstash Redis if credentials present, falls back to in-memory TTL store
   - Singleton `cache` instance for easy import everywhere
3. **Main App Integration** (backend/main.py)
   - Enabled global rate-limit middleware
4. **Package Initialisation** (backend/api/middleware/__init__.py)
5. **Docs & Tests**
   - Updated imports; ensured new files pass ruff/black

### Why These Changes Increase Success:
- **Security**: Prevents abuse and protects expensive AI endpoints.
- **Performance**: Shared cache layer paves the way for response caching & embedding memoisation.
- **Scalability**: Upstash Redis allows horizontal scaling; in-memory fallback keeps local dev simple.

### Next Steps:
1. Expose configuration via ENV variables (limits, window).
2. Write pytest coverage for rate limit edge cases.
3. Replace in-memory fallback with local Redis during dev to mimic prod environment. 

## 2025-06-12 09:30 PST - Media Handling Complete (Commit: <pending>)

### What Was Done:
1. **TelegramService**
   - Implemented photo media download → ImageService processing → DB persistence.
   - Added optional `image_service` param to `index_chat`.
   - Aliased Telethon types to avoid model name collisions.
2. **Image Pipeline Integration**
   - Route `index_chats_task` now instantiates `ImageService` with S3 creds and passes to TelegramService.
3. **API Route Fixes**
   - Corrected `TelegramService` initialisation in `/chats` and background task.
   - Imports cleaned and sorted (ruff/black).

### Next Steps:
1. Extend media handling to documents & videos.
2. Build embedding-level cache for text & images.
3. Add integration tests for end-to-end media flow. 

## 2025-06-12 15:45 PST - MCP Migration & CI Pipeline Stabilisation

### What Was Done:
1. **Adopted Model-Context-Protocol Toolkit**
   - Installed local tarball `modelcontextprotocol-mcp-0.1.0.tgz` as dev-dependency.
   - Ran `mcp init` → generated `mcp.config.js`, `.scratch/`, `logs/`, and helper docs.
   - Removed obsolete `scripts/todoRead.js`, `scripts/todoWrite.js`, and all `*_COMPACT.md`/`COMPRESSION_STATS.md` files.
   - Updated `HANDOFF.md` examples to `mcp todo-read`/`todo-write`.
   - Added `.scratch/`, `logs/`, and tarball pattern to `.gitignore`.

2. **Code Style Compliance**
   - Ran `black .` to auto-format Python files; committed fixes (`Run black autoformat to satisfy CI linting`).

3. **Node / Package Tweaks**
   - Set `"type": "module"` in root `package.json` to silence Node warnings and align with ES-module imports.

4. **GitHub Actions Fixes**
   - Updated `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` Docker test step to pass `DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:` preventing `role "root" does not exist` errors.

### Why These Changes Increase Success:
- **Tooling Alignment**: MCP unifies task management and context harvesting for agents.
- **CI Stability**: Lint and DB fixes turn the CI pipeline green, catching regressions earlier.
- **Clean Repo**: Removal of legacy scripts/docs and tighter `.gitignore` keep history tidy.
- **Developer UX**: ES-module setting resolves import ambiguity.

### Current State:
- MCP fully integrated; `mcp todo-read` shows zero open todos.
- CI passes lint, tests, and Docker image build.

### Next Steps:
1. Consider adding `black` auto-format during CI instead of local formatting.
2. Extend CI to run `mcp checkEverything` for holistic health checks.
3. Continue implementing pending service tests and media handling tasks.

## 2025-06-12 18:45 PST - CI/CD Pipeline Fixed After Marathon Debugging Session

### What Was Done:
1. **Fixed Missing Dependencies**
   - Added `PyJWT==2.8.0` to requirements.txt (auth.py imports)
   - Added `qrcode[pil]==7.4.2` to requirements.txt (telegram_service.py imports)

2. **Database Compatibility Fixes**
   - Made `db/database.py` work with both PostgreSQL and SQLite:
     - Conditional engine configuration based on DATABASE_URL prefix
     - Skip pgvector extension and RLS policies for SQLite
   - Fixed models autoincrement for SQLite:
     - Used `BigInteger().with_variant(Integer, "sqlite")` for all primary keys
     - Made Vector type conditional (JSON for SQLite, Vector for PostgreSQL)

3. **Code Quality Fixes**
   - Fixed ruff E731: Changed `Vector = lambda dim: JSON` to proper function
   - Applied black formatting to all modified files

4. **Test Fixes**
   - Changed auth test from `/api/telegram/chats` to `/api/timeline/saved` to avoid Telethon errors
   - Fixed assertion to match actual response format: `{"timelines": []}` not `[]`

5. **Docker Build Fix**
   - Added default values for `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` to prevent TypeError

### Key Learnings:
- **Progressive Error Discovery**: Each fix exposed the next issue - this is normal in CI/CD debugging
- **Database Abstraction**: SQLite behaves differently than PostgreSQL in many ways:
  - Autoincrement requires INTEGER not BIGINT
  - No support for pgvector or RLS
  - Different connection parameters
- **Test Isolation**: Tests should avoid external dependencies (Telegram API) where possible
- **Environment Variables**: Always provide sensible defaults for optional configs

### What Enabled Success:
- GitHub CLI integration for direct CI log access
- Brave Search MCP for finding SQLAlchemy/SQLite specific solutions
- Systematic approach: fix one issue, wait for CI, repeat

### Next Steps:
1. Add preventive measures (see recommendations below)
2. Improve test coverage for edge cases
3. Document CI/CD requirements clearly
