# Workflow State - [TASK_NAME]

## Current Phase: ANALYZE
<!-- Phases: IDLE, ANALYZE, BLUEPRINT, CONSTRUCT, VALIDATE -->

## Active Task
**Task**: [Brief description of the specific task]
**Started**: [Timestamp]
**Context**: [Any relevant context or dependencies]

## Next Action
[What needs to be done next in the current phase]

## Rules for AI
1. **Read** this file at the start of each response

3. **Execute** actions based on phase requirements
4. **Update** this file with new phase/progress
5. **Repeat** until task is complete

### Phase Definitions
- **ANALYZE**: Understand requirements, explore codebase, identify approach
- **BLUEPRINT**: Create detailed plan (requires user approval before proceeding)
- **CONSTRUCT**: Implement the solution following the blueprint
