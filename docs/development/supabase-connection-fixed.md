# Supabase Connection Fixed

## Issue Resolution
The Supabase connection issue has been resolved. The problem was using the new `sb_secret_` key format (41 chars) instead of the JWT-based `service_role` key.

### Key Findings:
1. Supabase is transitioning to new API key formats (`sb_secret_` and `sb_publishable_`)
2. The Python client (v2.15.3) still expects the old JWT format
3. The JWT service_role key (214 chars) works correctly

### Solution Applied:
- Updated `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in `.env.supabase_bot` to use the JWT service_role key
- Key format: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` (214 characters)

### Test Results:
✅ Client creation successful
✅ Auth endpoint accessible
✅ Bot starts and runs without errors
❌ Documents table doesn't exist (expected - needs to be created)

## Next Steps:
1. Create Supabase tables by running the SQL in `supabase_setup.sql`
2. Continue with Step 3 of the implementation plan (Telethon integration)
3. Add comprehensive logging throughout the codebase
