# Supabase API Key Issue - Resolution

## Problem
The Supabase Python client (v2.15.3) was throwing "Invalid API key" errors when trying to connect.

## Root Cause
The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in `.env.supabase_bot` was incomplete:
- Current key: `sb_secret_pTqSgvggYmpXncgQoq3P8Q_kH2YHm40` (41 characters)
- Expected length: ~223 characters
- The key was truncated during copy/paste from Supabase dashboard

## Solution
1. Go to Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/tzsfkbwpgklwvsyypacc/settings/api
2. Under "Secret keys" section, copy the **full** service_role key
3. Update `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in `.env.supabase_bot` with the complete key
4. Ensure the key starts with `sb_secret_` and is approximately 223 characters long

## Verification
After updating the key, run:
```bash
python verify_supabase_key.py
```

This should show:
- ✅ Has correct prefix (sb_secret_)
- ✅ Key length seems reasonable (~223 chars)
