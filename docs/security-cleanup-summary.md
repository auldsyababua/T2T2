# Security Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Pushed Changes
- Committed all pending changes to the `refactor/tdlib-chat-history` branch
- Pushed to remote repository

### 2. Cleaned Git History
- Used BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove all sensitive files from git history:
  - `CLAUDE.md`
  - `authorized_users.py`
  - `railway-bot-env.json`
  - `railway-env.json`
  - All `*.env` files
- Force pushed cleaned history to all branches (main, refactor/tdlib-chat-history, gh-pages)

### 3. Fixed GitHub Pages
- GitHub Pages is configured to serve from the `gh-pages` branch root
- Copied `qr-auth.html` to the root of the `gh-pages` branch
- Updated the chat indexer bot to use the correct URL: `https://auldsyababua.github.io/T2T2/qr-auth.html`
- Verified the page is now accessible (HTTP 200)

### 4. Security Status
- All sensitive files have been removed from git history
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` is in place to prevent future exposure
- No credentials are hardcoded in any tracked files

## Critical Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Rotate All Exposed Credentials

The following credentials were exposed and MUST be rotated immediately:

1. **Telegram Bot Token**: `8165476295:AAFyLp4vqtHwFngH5MYDn5eOd2DdibHFGLo`
   - Go to @BotFather on Telegram
   - Use `/mybots` → Select your bot → API Token → Revoke current token

2. **OpenAI API Key** (from railway-env.json)
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Delete the exposed key and create a new one

3. **AWS Credentials** (from railway-env.json)
   - Log into AWS Console
   - Go to IAM → Users → Your user → Security credentials
   - Delete the exposed access key and create a new one

4. **Supabase Keys** (from various config files)
   - Go to your Supabase project settings
   - Regenerate both anon and service role keys

5. **Telegram API ID/Hash** (if exposed)
   - Go to https://my.telegram.org
   - Consider regenerating if compromised

## GitHub Pages Configuration

- **URL**: https://auldsyababua.github.io/T2T2/
- **Branch**: `gh-pages`
- **QR Auth Page**: https://auldsyababua.github.io/T2T2/qr-auth.html
- **Docs Index**: https://auldsyababua.github.io/T2T2/docs/

## Development vs Production

Currently, the QR authentication is configured to use `localhost:5000` as the backend server. For production:

1. Deploy the QR auth server (`t2t2_qr_auth.py`) to a cloud service (Railway, Render, etc.)
2. Update the `server_url` in `t2t2_chat_indexer.py` to use the production URL
3. Consider using environment variables to switch between development and production URLs

## Bot Message Delay Issue

You mentioned that bot messages were delayed by 3 minutes. This could be due to:
1. Telegram's rate limiting
2. Server processing delays
3. The periodic check interval in the bot (currently 5 seconds)

Consider monitoring the bot logs to identify the source of the delay.
