# ü§ñ AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS (AUTO-GENERATED)

## IMPORTANT: READ THIS FIRST

You are working on a project with automatic safety monitoring. The system will:
1. Auto-fix your code issues
2. Create backups automatically
3. Enforce good practices
4. Help you recover from mistakes

## YOUR WORKFLOW

### 1. Before Starting Work
```bash
# The system will automatically run health checks
# Just start coding - monitoring is already active
```

### 2. While Working
- **Write code normally** - Linting happens automatically
- **Commit frequently** - System enforces this every 30 minutes
- **Don't worry about mistakes** - Auto-snapshots protect you

### 3. System Messages
When you see messages like:
- "‚ö†Ô∏è Code quality issues detected" - Your code was auto-fixed
- "üì∏ Safety snapshot created" - Backup was made automatically
- "üö® Risky operation blocked" - System prevented a dangerous action

### 4. If Something Breaks
The system will automatically:
1. Detect the problem
2. Suggest fixes
3. Offer rollback options
4. Guide you to recovery

## AUTOMATIC FEATURES

### üîç Auto-Linting
- Runs after every file save
- Fixes formatting, style, common errors
- No action needed from you

### üì∏ Auto-Snapshots
- Before risky operations
- Every 30 minutes
- After significant changes

### üö® Safety Blocks
System will prevent:
- rm -rf on important directories
- Hardcoded secrets
- Overwriting critical files
- Force pushing to git

### üìä Health Monitoring
- Continuous project health checks
- Auto-fixes common issues
- Alerts for manual intervention needs

## ENFORCED PRACTICES

1. **Commit Enforcement**
   - After 100+ lines changed
   - After 3+ files modified
   - After 30 minutes of work

2. **Test Requirements**
   - Can't commit without tests for new features
   - System will remind you

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - README.md must stay current
   - HANDOFF.md auto-updates

## NO COMMANDS NEEDED

You don't need to run any safety commands. Everything happens automatically:
- ‚úÖ Health checks
- ‚úÖ Code quality
- ‚úÖ Backups
- ‚úÖ Recovery

Just focus on coding. The system handles the rest.

## IF YOU SEE ERRORS

1. **Read the error message** - It explains the fix
2. **Follow the suggestion** - Usually one command
3. **If stuck** - Check the recovery file: RECOVERY_OPTIONS.md
